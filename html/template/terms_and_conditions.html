    <h2>5. Removed </h2>
    <h2>6. Obligations of THE GAMING ZONE</h2>
    <p>6.1. Under the condition of meeting the requirements specified in these Terms and Conditions by the Seller and the Selling User, THE GAMING ZONE shall provide every Selling User and Seller with the opportunity to set up and operate his/her Seller&rsquo;s Store. However, bearing in mind the THE GAMING ZONE business principles and the care of the THE GAMING ZONE brand, the Seller and/or the Selling User using THE GAMING ZONE services to operate their Seller&rsquo;s Store must follow all applicable guidelines established by the applicable law and could follow good practices recommended by THE GAMING ZONE aimed at ensuring highest level of security of ecommerce transactions. The guidelines below are examples of practices that may be used by the Seller and/or the Selling User when selling via the Seller&rsquo;s Store. Nevertheless, the above does not exclude the Seller&rsquo;s and/or Selling User&rsquo;s responsibility for operations, transactions and activity performed within his/her Seller&rsquo;s Store.</p>
    <p>6.2. Unless otherwise provided by THE GAMING ZONE, the Seller and the Selling User may only sell on their Sellers&rsquo; Stores the products in the digital form, i.e. such products which may be downloaded by the Users to their workstations&rsquo; hard drive. Such products are not stored on material media carriers.</p>
    <p>6.3. The Seller or the Selling User determines the price of products which he/she intends to sell on his/her Seller&rsquo;s Store. Subject to point 2.1 above, THE GAMING ZONE collects its commission or other possible fees (if such are due) from the amount of such price. The Users and the Sellers acknowledge and accept the fact that THE GAMING ZONE may, as part of Additional Provisions mentioned in 1.6 above, set with a given Selling User or Seller commissions and fees being other from those defined in these Terms and Conditions including possible attachments.</p>
    <p>6.4. By adding the product by the Seller or the Selling User to his/her Seller&rsquo;s Store he or she authorizes THE GAMING ZONE to present the product on the Site as an invitation to enter into agreement by Users willing to purchase the product offered by a given Seller&rsquo;s Store at a price determined by this Seller&rsquo;s Store. As such it does not constitute a sales offer within the meaning of the civil law. Provided that no User (or other Seller) has expressed the will to enter into agreement of buying the product, the Seller or the Selling User may change the product&rsquo;s price. In case of the price change, provisions defined in 6.3 above are directly applied. The Seller and the Selling User acknowledge and accept that their offer presented within the Seller&rsquo;s Store (e.g., product listings, prices and descriptions) is made public and available for all Users of the Site.</p>
    <p>6.5. If the User (or the Seller making a purchase) expresses the will to buy a product from chosen Seller&rsquo;s Store, he/she acknowledges that such Seller&rsquo;s Store may be entitled to withdraw from concluding a contract of selling the product according to delivery and payment authorization preferences set by this Seller&rsquo;s Store.</p>
    <p>6.6. Moreover, the Parties mutually agree that their due payments made by the Users (or Sellers if they have purchased goods from other Sellers) may be paid by these Users (or Sellers) by means of a chosen payment channel (e.g. PayPal, Skrill, DotPay, PaySafeCard, MoneyBookers) or outside the TGZ Ecosystem. For the avoidance of doubt, the Users are not obliged to make the payments solely via methods offered on the Site; provided however, the Users shall be responsible for ensuring that the payment has been duly and securely made, documented and all information has been communicated with the Seller or Selling User. From the funds collected on its account, THE GAMING ZONE deducts its due commissions and fees indicated in these Terms and Conditions from the Seller and the Selling User, by making deductions from the funds, whereas the remaining part shall be transferred to the Seller&rsquo;s or the Selling User&rsquo;s bank account.</p>
    <p>6.7. The commission paid by the Seller or the Selling User to THE GAMING ZONE is non-returnable, in particular in a situation when the payment, which shall be settled in relation to these Terms and Conditions, made by the User (or other Seller) for products or services purchased from the Seller or the Selling User, would have to be returned by the Seller or the Selling User to the User (or other Seller) (e.g. as a result of the User&rsquo;s complaint caused by faults of the products or services provided by the Seller or the Selling User). Due to the commission being non-returnable, the Seller and the Selling User are not entitled to claim any compensation from THE GAMING ZONE and THE GAMING ZONE may retain the sums of back commissions, contractual penalties and compensations costs which the Seller or the Selling User shall cover.</p>
    <p>6.8. Notwithstanding provisions stipulated in point 6.7 above, THE GAMING ZONE provides tools and features that enable resolution mechanisms for Sellers&rsquo; Stores and their customers &ndash; via Help Desk functionality available on the Seller&rsquo;s Store &ndash; in order to clarify the reasons for demanding refund by the User. Seller may choose to use different resolution mechanisms on his/her Seller&rsquo;s Store. Depending on the conclusions of such resolution, the funds shall be returned by the Seller or the Selling User or shall not be returned to the User, who may vindicate his claims against the Seller or the Selling User at court or in any other way.</p>
    <p>6.9. Notwithstanding the above, THE GAMING ZONE is not entitled to dispose of and manage the funds transferred by the Users/Sellers in relation to purchases of products or services from the Sellers&rsquo; Stores.</p>
    <p>6.10. THE GAMING ZONE provides exemplary, pre-prepared templates of descriptions of selected product categories, which may be offered by the Seller&rsquo;s Store &ndash; basing on the information provided by a given Seller&rsquo;s Store. Templates of the product descriptions should be used for reference only and not as a substitute for independent assessment of specific product features. The Seller and the Selling User are obliged to provide reliable and complete information needed to prepare the product descriptions, in compliance with real product features such as quality, producer or brand. THE GAMING ZONE is obliged to prepare reliable product descriptions, corresponding to the product&rsquo;s content. The product descriptions are available for every product under the tab &bdquo;product details&rdquo;. However, THE GAMING ZONE assumes no responsibility for the compliance of the product description with its content, in a situation when the Seller or the Selling User misinforms THE GAMING ZONE regarding the product, its access to a given gaming platform, etc. The Seller and the Selling User hereby entitle THE GAMING ZONE to use the information defined here and provided by them free of charge, to prepare descriptions of products being sold, including modifications, alterations, translation of this content into other languages, etc.</p>
    <p>6.11. THE GAMING ZONE shall provide the Users and the Sellers with technical support in case of encountering problems with the functionality of the Site, Seller&rsquo;s Store, or Account.</p>
    <p>6.12. In case of a purchase transaction, in connection to which the payment is performed by Users by means of a credit card, an affiliate party THE GAMING ZONE Sp.z o.o. accepts and assumes (together with the Seller) responsibility against the User. THE GAMING ZONE Sp.z o.o. assumes responsibility against User in terms of order compliance, correct functioning of the payment and any potential legal faults, customer support functions are performed by TGZ PL. THE GAMING ZONE Sp.z o.o. responsibility concerns solely these products, for which the User pays by means of a credit card. The responsibility described here does not constitute taking over the Seller&rsquo;s responsibility by THE GAMING ZONE Sp.z o.o. It only concerns participation in this responsibility in the scope mentioned above; which means in particular that the Seller still assumes the responsibility against the User. Participation in the responsibility does not mean that THE GAMING ZONE Sp.z o.o. becomes the owner or co-owner of the product sold by the Seller &ndash; the Seller remains the exclusive owner and the supplier of the product being sold.</p>
